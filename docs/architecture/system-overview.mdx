# SpecifyX System Architecture

This document provides a consolidated architecture reference for SpecifyX. It
summarizes how services, templates, and tooling interact so that new
contributors have a single entry point when extending the platform.

## Service-Oriented Design

SpecifyX is composed of focused services that expose clear contracts. Each
service owns a single responsibility and can be tested independently.

```
src/specify_cli/services/
├── assistant_management_service/
├── config_service/
├── template_service/
├── project_manager/
├── download_service/
├── git_service/
├── memory_service/
└── update_service/
```

Key principles:

- **Type-safe contracts** using abstract base classes and Pydantic models.
- **Dependency injection** so callers can swap implementations in tests or
  extended workflows.
- **Cross-platform awareness** – file permissions, paths, and subprocesses are
  normalized through utility helpers.

## Template Pipeline

Jinja2 templates are rendered through the `TemplateService`, which merges
project context, assistant-specific injection values, and generated metadata.

```
TemplateContext -> JinjaTemplateService -> rendered project files
```

Highlights:

- Injection points expose assistant-specific behavior without forked templates.
- Template folder mappings describe how rendered assets are written to the
  project tree.
- Memory imports and context scripts are refreshed automatically after renders.

## Documentation Sync

The docs pipeline mirrors project documentation from code, specs, and
architecture references into the Docusaurus site. See the `docs/scripts`
tooling for the full synchronization workflow, which now includes an explicit
`architecture` documentation type.

## Cross-Platform Considerations

- Paths are converted with `ensure_system_path` helpers before any filesystem
  operations run.
- Permission helpers set executable bits only on platforms that support them
  and simulate success when mocked in tests.
- Windows-safe fallbacks are provided for archive extraction and CLI scripts.

## Extensibility Checklist

1. Define new service interfaces and implementations under
   `src/specify_cli/services`.
2. Add documentation to the architecture reference to describe new flows.
3. Update templates with injection points rather than assistant-specific logic.
4. Expand tests – contract, integration, and unit – to capture new behavior.

Use this page as the authoritative guide when planning significant structural
changes to the CLI internals.
