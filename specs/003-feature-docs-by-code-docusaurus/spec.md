# Feature Specification: Implement documentation-by-code pattern with Docusaurus for better maintainability

**Feature Branch**: `feature/docs-by-code-docusaurus`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Input**: User description: "Implement documentation-by-code pattern with Docusaurus for better maintainability"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or documentation contributor working on SpecifyX, I want documentation to live alongside the code it describes, so that documentation stays accurate and is naturally updated when code changes. When I modify a command or service, I can immediately update its documentation in the same location, and an automated process ensures this documentation is properly formatted and published to our user-facing documentation site.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer modifies a CLI command implementation, **When** they update the documentation file in the same directory, **Then** the documentation site automatically reflects these changes after running the sync process
2. **Given** a new CLI command is added to the codebase, **When** the developer creates a documentation file alongside it, **Then** the documentation site automatically includes this new command reference
3. **Given** documentation exists alongside code, **When** a developer runs the documentation development server, **Then** they can preview all synchronized documentation in real-time
4. **Given** a service or command is removed from the codebase, **When** the sync process runs, **Then** its documentation is automatically removed from the documentation site
5. **Given** a user visits the documentation site, **When** they navigate to command references, **Then** they see accurate, up-to-date documentation that matches the current codebase

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation file is missing for a command? System should detect and report undocumented commands
- How does system handle malformed documentation files? Sync process should validate and report errors without breaking the entire documentation build
- What happens during file watching when multiple files change simultaneously? All changes should be processed correctly without race conditions
- How does system handle documentation for deprecated but not yet removed commands? Documentation should indicate deprecation status clearly

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow documentation files to be stored alongside their corresponding code files
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically synchronize documentation from code directories to the documentation site structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST support both manual one-time sync and automatic file-watching modes for development
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve documentation formatting and metadata during synchronization
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a professional, searchable documentation website accessible via web browser
- **FR-006**: Documentation site MUST include navigation structure for commands, services, guides, and API references
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate documentation files during sync and report any issues found
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically remove documentation for deleted components from the site
- **FR-009**: Documentation site MUST support versioning for different releases of the software
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages when documentation sync fails
- **FR-011**: Documentation MUST be searchable with relevant results for user queries
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both markdown and enhanced markdown formats for documentation
- **FR-013**: Documentation build process MUST be automatable for continuous deployment
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation content
- **FR-015**: Documentation site MUST be deployable to standard web hosting platforms

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Command Documentation**: Represents documentation for CLI commands, including usage, options, examples, and related information
- **Service Documentation**: Represents API documentation for internal services, including methods, parameters, and return values
- **Guide Documentation**: Represents conceptual guides and tutorials that are not tied to specific code components
- **Documentation Metadata**: Represents frontmatter and configuration for each documentation page including title, description, and navigation ordering
- **Sync Configuration**: Represents the mapping between source documentation locations and destination site structure
