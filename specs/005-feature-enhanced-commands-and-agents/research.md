# Research: Enhanced Commands and Agent Support System

## Command Template Architecture

**Decision**: Use Jinja2 templates for slash command definitions, stored in `.specify/templates/commands/`
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing SpecifyX template architecture, allows parameterized command generation
**Alternatives considered**:
- Hardcoded command templates: Rejected - lacks flexibility
- YAML-based commands: Rejected - less expressive than Jinja2

## Task Execution Engine

**Decision**: Implement sequential task parser with dependency tracking and parallel execution support
**Rationale**: Tasks.md has structured format with [P] markers, dependencies require ordered execution
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple sequential execution: Rejected - misses parallel optimization opportunities
- Complex DAG solver: Rejected - over-engineering for current use case

## Agent Template System

**Decision**: Three-layer agent file architecture during init:
1. Agent scaffold scripts (`.specify/scripts/`) - executable Python scripts
2. Agent prompt templates - Jinja2 templates rendered to assistant directories during init
3. Agent runtime templates (`.specify/agent-templates/`) - copied during init, rendered by scripts

**Rationale**: Separates concerns - init-time vs runtime, assistant-specific vs SpecifyX-managed
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single template type: Rejected - conflates different usage patterns
- Runtime-only generation: Rejected - requires assistant directory detection at runtime

## Context Sharing Mechanism

**Decision**: File-based context sharing via `.specify/agents/` directory with scaffolded report templates
**Rationale**: SpecifyX generates empty report outlines, external agents populate them, orchestrator reads completed reports for context
**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory sharing: Rejected - doesn't persist across command invocations
- Database storage: Rejected - adds external dependency

## Progress Tracking Implementation

**Decision**: Rich-based progress display with step tracking and error recovery
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing SpecifyX UI patterns, supports complex nested operations
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple print statements: Rejected - poor user experience
- External progress libraries: Rejected - Rich already integrated

## Command Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Register new commands through existing app.py registration pattern
**Rationale**: Follows established SpecifyX architecture, maintains consistency
**Alternatives considered**:
- Plugin system: Rejected - over-engineering for core commands
- Separate CLI entry points: Rejected - fragments user experience

## Template Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Schema-based validation using Pydantic models for agent templates and command definitions
**Rationale**: Type safety, runtime validation, consistent with existing SpecifyX validation patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual validation: Rejected - error-prone
- JSON Schema: Rejected - Pydantic provides better Python integration

## Error Handling and Recovery

**Decision**: Implement hierarchical error handling with context preservation and recovery suggestions
**Rationale**: Complex multi-step operations need graceful failure modes with actionable feedback
**Alternatives considered**:
- Fail-fast approach: Rejected - poor user experience for long operations
- Silent error handling: Rejected - makes debugging difficult

## Configuration Extension

**Decision**: Extend existing `.specify/config.toml` with agent-specific sections
**Rationale**: Maintains single source of configuration truth, leverages existing Dynaconf integration
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate agent config files: Rejected - fragments configuration
- Environment variables: Rejected - doesn't support complex nested configuration

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer testing approach:
- Contract tests for command interfaces
- Integration tests for full command workflows
- Unit tests for individual services
- Template rendering tests

**Rationale**: Complex feature requires comprehensive testing at all levels
**Alternatives considered**:
- Unit tests only: Rejected - misses integration issues
- End-to-end tests only: Rejected - difficult to debug, slow feedback
