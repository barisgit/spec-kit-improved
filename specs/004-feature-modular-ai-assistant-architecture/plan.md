# Implementation Plan: Feature/type-Safe-Ai-Assistant-Organization

**Branch**: `feature/modular-ai-assistant-architecture` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: [-feature/modular-ai-assistant-architecture/spec.md](/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md for Claude Code.
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Reorganize SpecifyX's AI assistant code from scattered files into organized assistant folders with type-safe injection points and auto-documentation. Replace template conditionals with clean injection points while maintaining full type safety and automatic documentation generation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Type safety implementation patterns for dynamic configurations
   - Template injection point design patterns
   - Python type checking integration with build process
   - Documentation auto-generation from typed definitions

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Python type safety patterns for plugin-like configurations"
   Task: "Find template injection patterns that maintain type safety"
   Task: "Research auto-documentation generation from Python type annotations"
   Task: "Investigate build-time validation patterns for Python CLI tools"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - AssistantConfig (Pydantic BaseModel for assistant definitions with field validation)
   - InjectionPoint (String Enum for type-safe injection point constants)
   - ValidationResult (Pydantic model for structured validation feedback)
   - AssistantProvider (ABC with abstract methods for assistant implementations)
   - AssistantFactory (ABC for creation and lifecycle management)
   - AssistantRegistry (ABC for centralized assistant management)

2. **Generate interface contracts** from functional requirements:
   - AssistantProvider ABC with abstract methods (config, get_injection_values, validate_setup, get_setup_instructions)
   - AssistantFactory ABC for instance creation and availability checking
   - AssistantRegistry ABC for centralized management and validation
   - Pydantic models with field validators and JSON schema generation
   - Output ABC/Pydantic/Enum definitions to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Pydantic AssistantConfig validation tests (field validation, path consistency)
   - ABC implementation enforcement tests (abstract method requirements)
   - Enum injection point validation tests (type safety, value constraints)
   - Runtime validation performance tests (<50ms validation target)
   - JSON schema generation tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Assistant folder organization scenarios
   - Type-safe injection point scenarios
   - Auto-documentation generation scenarios
   - Quickstart test = organization validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - Add assistant organization and type safety context
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Assistant configuration interfaces → contract test tasks [P]
- Type safety validation → validation test tasks [P]
- Injection point system → integration test tasks
- Template enhancement → rendering test tasks
- Folder organization → file structure tasks
- Implementation tasks following TDD red-green-refactor

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Unit tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Types → Configuration → Injections → Templates → Integration
- Organization tasks: Create folders → Move files → Update imports → Validate
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent assistant folders)

**Key Task Categories**:
1. **Pydantic Type System** (3-4 tasks): BaseModel configurations, field validators, JSON schema
2. **ABC Architecture** (4-5 tasks): Abstract interfaces, implementation enforcement, contracts
3. **Enum-based Injection System** (3-4 tasks): Type-safe constants, validation, template integration
4. **Template Enhancement** (2-3 tasks): Remove conditionals, add enum-based injection points
5. **Runtime Validation** (2-3 tasks): Performance optimization, error handling, schema generation
6. **Integration & Testing** (3-4 tasks): End-to-end validation, ABC compliance, backward compatibility

**Estimated Output**: 18-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Performance Requirements**:
- Template rendering benchmarks (maintain current speed <100ms)
- Pydantic validation performance (<50ms for configuration validation)
- Runtime validation overhead (<10ms per assistant operation)
- JSON schema generation efficiency
- ABC method resolution time
- Type checking integration validation
- Build-time validation implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, type checking validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| (None) | Simple folder organization | No constitutional violations |
