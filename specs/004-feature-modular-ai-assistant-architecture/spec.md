# Feature Specification: Type-Safe AI Assistant Organization System

**Feature Branch**: `feature/modular-ai-assistant-architecture`
**Created**: 2025-09-12
**Status**: Revised - Simplified Approach
**Input**: User description: "modular AI assistant plugin system"

## Executive Summary
Reorganize SpecifyX's AI assistant code from scattered files into organized assistant folders with type-safe injection points and auto-documentation. Replace template conditionals with clean injection points while maintaining full type safety and automatic documentation generation. This enables easier maintenance, cleaner code organization, and simpler addition of new AI assistants.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a SpecifyX maintainer, I want all AI assistant logic organized in dedicated folders with type-safe injection points, so that adding new AI assistants requires minimal changes, templates remain clean and assistant-agnostic, and the codebase auto-documents available assistants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new AI assistant needs to be added, **When** I create a new assistant folder with typed configuration and injections, **Then** the system automatically includes it with full type checking and documentation
2. **Given** templates use injection points, **When** I view any template, **Then** I see clean, assistant-agnostic placeholders instead of conditional logic
3. **Given** assistant configurations are typed, **When** I modify an assistant definition, **Then** the system validates all required fields and injection points at build time
4. **Given** multiple AI assistants exist, **When** I generate documentation, **Then** all assistants are automatically included with their capabilities and requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an assistant definition is missing required injection points?
- How does system handle type mismatches in assistant configurations?
- What occurs when injection point names conflict between assistants?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST organize all AI assistant logic into dedicated assistant folders for better code organization
- **FR-002**: Templates MUST use type-safe, assistant-agnostic injection points instead of conditional logic
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide full TypeScript-style type safety for all assistant configurations and injections
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST auto-generate from typed assistant definitions without manual maintenance
- **FR-005**: New AI assistants MUST be addable by creating a single folder with typed configuration file
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all assistant configurations and injection points at build/runtime
- **FR-007**: Injection points MUST have clear, documented interfaces that any assistant can implement
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing projects and configurations
- **FR-009**: Assistant registry MUST use static imports (no dynamic discovery) for performance and reliability
- **FR-010**: All assistant capabilities MUST be discoverable through type-safe interfaces

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Assistant addition MUST require minimal code changes (ideally just adding folder + one import)
- **NFR-002**: Template rendering MUST maintain current performance (no degradation)
- **NFR-003**: Build-time validation MUST catch all configuration errors before runtime
- **NFR-004**: Documentation generation MUST be automatic and always current

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Assistant Configuration**: Typed data structure defining assistant properties, directories, and capabilities
- **Injection Registry**: Type-safe mapping of injection point names to assistant-provided values
- **Template Context**: Enhanced context object that includes assistant injections with type validation
- **Assistant Module**: Self-contained folder with configuration, injections, and optional template overrides
