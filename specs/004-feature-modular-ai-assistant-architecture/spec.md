# Feature Specification: Type-Safe AI Assistant Organization System

**Feature Branch**: `feature/modular-ai-assistant-architecture`
**Created**: 2025-09-12
**Status**: Revised - Simplified Approach
**Input**: User description: "modular AI assistant plugin system"

## Executive Summary
Reorganize SpecifyX's AI assistant code from scattered files into organized assistant folders with Pydantic-validated models, Abstract Base Classes, and type-safe injection points. Replace template conditionals with enum-based injection points while providing runtime validation, JSON schema generation, and automatic documentation. This enables easier maintenance, cleaner code organization, robust validation, and simpler addition of new AI assistants through clear ABC contracts.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a SpecifyX maintainer, I want all AI assistant logic organized in dedicated folders with type-safe injection points, so that adding new AI assistants requires minimal changes, templates remain clean and assistant-agnostic, and the codebase auto-documents available assistants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new AI assistant needs to be added, **When** I create a new assistant folder with typed configuration and injections, **Then** the system automatically includes it with full type checking and documentation
2. **Given** templates use injection points, **When** I view any template, **Then** I see clean, assistant-agnostic placeholders instead of conditional logic
3. **Given** assistant configurations are typed, **When** I modify an assistant definition, **Then** the system validates all required fields and injection points at build time
4. **Given** multiple AI assistants exist, **When** I generate documentation, **Then** all assistants are automatically included with their capabilities and requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an assistant definition is missing required injection points?
- How does system handle type mismatches in assistant configurations?
- What occurs when injection point names conflict between assistants?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST organize all AI assistant logic into dedicated assistant folders with Pydantic models and Abstract Base Classes
- **FR-002**: Templates MUST use enum-based, assistant-agnostic injection points instead of conditional logic
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide Pydantic-based runtime validation with detailed error messages for all configurations
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate JSON schemas automatically from Pydantic models for API documentation
- **FR-005**: New AI assistants MUST implement Abstract Base Class contracts ensuring consistent interfaces
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all assistant configurations at runtime using Pydantic field validators
- **FR-007**: Injection points MUST use type-safe Enums with clear documentation for all assistant implementations
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility through Pydantic serialization/deserialization
- **FR-009**: Assistant registry MUST use Abstract Base Classes with static factory pattern for type safety
- **FR-010**: All assistant capabilities MUST be discoverable through ABC method contracts and JSON schema introspection

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Assistant addition MUST require only ABC implementation and Pydantic model creation
- **NFR-002**: Template rendering MUST maintain current performance through efficient enum-based injection
- **NFR-003**: Pydantic validation MUST catch all configuration errors at model instantiation time
- **NFR-004**: JSON schema generation MUST be automatic from Pydantic models with no manual maintenance
- **NFR-005**: Runtime validation MUST provide clear, actionable error messages for configuration issues

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Assistant Configuration**: Pydantic BaseModel with field validation, JSON schema generation, and immutability
- **Injection Point Registry**: Enum-based type-safe mapping with runtime validation and introspection
- **Assistant Provider**: Abstract Base Class defining required methods and contracts for all assistants
- **Template Context**: Enhanced Pydantic model with assistant injections and cross-field validation
- **Assistant Factory**: Abstract factory pattern for creating validated assistant instances
