# Spec-Kit-Improved Constitution
<!-- Generated by SpecifyX for claude workflow -->

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
Every feature starts with a specification; Implementation follows the six-phase lifecycle: Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement; No code without user-approved specifications; Clear acceptance criteria required for all features.

### II. Template-Based Consistency  
All specifications, plans, and tasks follow standardized templates; Jinja2 templates ensure consistent variable substitution; Project structure maintained across all features; Documentation generated from templates stays current.

### III. Test-First Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Integration tests required for new services and API changes; Contract tests validate all external interfaces.

### IV. AI Assistant Integration
AI assistant commands (specify, clarify, plan, tasks, analyze, implement, guide) drive the workflow; Python scripts provide cross-platform reliability; Generated commands integrate seamlessly with any AI assistant's capabilities; All templates support assistant-specific features and syntax.


### V. Cross-Platform Python Implementation
Python scripts replace bash dependencies for Windows compatibility; SpecifyX utilities imported for consistency and code reuse; Error handling and validation built into all generated scripts; JSON output modes for programmatic integration.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Standards
Default branch pattern: `001-feature-name`; Spec directories match branch names for consistency; Sequential numbering ensures proper feature ordering; Custom patterns can be configured per project.


### File Organization
Configuration stored in `.specify/config.toml` using TOML format; Templates in `.specify/templates/` for user customization; Python scripts in `.specify/scripts/` with executable permissions; Memory files in `.specify/memory/` for project documentation; AI-specific commands in `.claude/commands/` directory.

### Quality Gates
All generated files must pass validation before use; Templates must render without errors; Python scripts must execute successfully; Git operations must complete cleanly; User prompts must validate input before processing.

## Technology Standards

### Template Processing
Jinja2 templates with AI-aware conditional logic; One template generates exactly one target file; Variable substitution for project context and user preferences; Template inheritance discouraged in favor of composition; Runtime templates stay as .j2 for dynamic generation.

### Script Implementation  
Python 3.11+ compatibility required; SpecifyX service imports for consistency; Argparse for command-line interface; JSON output modes for automation; Proper error handling with meaningful messages.

### Configuration Management
TOML format for all configuration files; Project-specific settings in `.specify/config.toml`; No global configuration dependencies; ConfigService integration for validation; Branch naming patterns and AI assistant preferences.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all generated code and templates; Amendments require template updates and regeneration; Project-specific overrides allowed through configuration; Use generated scripts for runtime development guidance; AI assistant commands must follow constitutional principles.
